# Vital Care Solutions - Health Care Patient Management System

Welcome to **Vital Care Solutions**, a project that simulates a database for managing healthcare patient data. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a healthcare patient management system using Microsoft SQL Server, utilizing a **star schema** for optimized reporting and data management.

## Project Overview

The **Vital Care Solutions** database is designed for efficient management of patient information, doctor details, treatments, prescriptions, and appointment scheduling. It serves as a robust backend for healthcare data management systems and supports advanced reporting with tools like Tableau and Power BI.

## Features

- **Star Schema Design**: Optimized for analytical and reporting purposes.
- **Comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Visual representation of database structure (see `Vital_care_Solutions_ERD`).
- **Core Tables**:
  - **Dimension Tables**:
    - `Patients_Dim`: Stores patient demographic data.
    - `Doctors_Dim`: Contains doctor details and specializations.
    - `Treatments_Dim`: Lists available treatments.
    - `Medications_Dim`: Contains medication details.
  - **Bridge Table**:
    - `Prescription_Bridge`: Links treatments and medications.
  - **Fact Table**:
    - `Appointments_Fact`: Stores patient appointments and related details.
- **Dummy Data**: Includes sample records to simulate real-world scenarios while adhering to HIPAA regulations.
- **SQL Scripts**: Ready-to-use scripts for database creation, schema definition, and data insertion.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vital-care-solutions.git
   ```
2. Open the SQL script file (`vital_care_solutions.sql`) in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL Server-compatible tool.
3. Run the script to create the database, tables, and populate it with dummy data.

## Database Schema

The database follows a **star schema** design:
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `Patients_Dim`
  - `Doctors_Dim`
  - `Treatments_Dim`
  - `Medications_Dim`
- **Bridge Table**:
  - `Prescription_Bridge`
- **Fact Table**:
  - `Appointments_Fact`

For a detailed understanding of the schema, refer to the ERD file: `Vital_care_Solutions_ERD`.

## Sample Queries

Here are some sample queries to demonstrate the usage of the database:

1. **List all appointments scheduled for January 2025**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM Appointments_Fact 
   WHERE AppointmentDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31';
   ```

2. **Find all medications prescribed for a specific treatment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT m.Name, m.Dosage
   FROM Prescription_Bridge pb
   JOIN Medications_Dim m ON pb.MedicationID = m.MedicationID
   WHERE pb.TreatmentID = 1;
   ```

3. **Generate a report of completed appointments along with the cost**:
   ```sql
   SELECT af.AppointmentID, p.FirstName AS Patient, d.FirstName AS Doctor, af.Cost
   FROM Appointments_Fact af
   JOIN Patients_Dim p ON af.PatientID = p.PatientID
   JOIN Doctors_Dim d ON af.DoctorID = d.DoctorID
   WHERE af.Status = 'Completed';
   ```
